# Surfs Up
# Surfs Up Challenge

## Challenge Overview
Avy likes our analysis, however, he wants for information on temperature trends, particulary the months, June and December in Oahu to inform him about possible best locations for surf and ice cream shops.

## Resources:
- Data Sources: hawaii.sqlite, https://weatherspark.com/y/139/Average-Weather-in-Honolulu-Hawaii-United-States-Year-Round for weather diagram
- Software: Python 3.8.8, Visual Studio Code 1.63.2, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, Pandas 1.3.3, Matplotlib 3.3.4, Pandas 1.2.4, Numpy 1.20.1, sqlalchemy 1.4.7, 

## Results:

June Statistics for the Temperature and Precipitation

### Three Major Points From the Analysis
- The mean temperatures for both periods is only a difference of less than 4 degrees between June, 74.9°F, and December, 71.0°F.  Both of which are in a comfortable zone for outdoor water activities.
- The max and min of the temperature values for both periods, are also in near comparison.  With quick Google search, it is easy to determine why this might be the case, as the end of June is the start of the Hot season and December is at the beginning of the cold season.  Both time periods corrolate to rising and falling temperatures in the same seasonal cycle.

- The amount of data collected for December is 1,517 items versus 1,700 for June.  This disparity can lead to some of the standard deviation differences as well as some incomplete data, December std is 3.75 and June's is 3.26.  However, given Hawaii's tropical climate and location on the Tropic of Cancer, also leads to minimal temperature extremes and small seasonal differnces versus a more norther climate such as Minnesota.

## Summary:
Based on this last request, temperature alone shows no discernable difference between the two months asked for the inquiry.  The other factor, based on the work done preciously on precipation should also be included on a decision if this location can support ice cream sales and surfing, and if there is a direct correlation between those items.
To get a better handle on this, the investor needs to ask for additional queries to be made.  The first question relates to real estate in general and that is location.  It will not matter how nice the termperatures are or how litte percipation occurs, if it does not have high foot traffic and ease of access to get there from roads and beach access.  The next query should focus on this item to increase success in retail.
The other query could be wind data.  Waves for surfing tend to be generated from wind power, and if this location is sheltered from the wind, surfing will not occur in any great capacity.
With these two additional queries, the investor will have a more complete picture and scenarios of success for the location of the next surf and ice cream shop.
